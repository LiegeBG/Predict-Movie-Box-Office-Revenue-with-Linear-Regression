# Predict-Movie-Box-Office-Revenue-with-Linear-Regression
Predicting Movie Box Office Revenue by using Linear Regression in Python.
First collecting data and clean the as desired
Import pandas and form pandas import dataframe to get the data and work with it
Import matplotlib and from matplotlib import pyplot to show the data in graph
from Scikit learn import Linear Regression to calculate Linear Regression formula
formula: h_0(x) = θ0 + θ1 . x
h_0(x) = Hypotenuos 
θ0 = constant (point where the line touches y-axis)
θ1 . x = slope
the line is called prediction line 
dots are the data points are the 
distance between the data ponts and the prediction line is called Residual line
