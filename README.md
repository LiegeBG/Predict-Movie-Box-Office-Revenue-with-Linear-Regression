# Predict-Movie-Box-Office-Revenue-with-Linear-Regression
Predicting Movie Box Office Revenue by using Linear Regression in Python .
First collecting data and clean the as desired .
Import pandas and form pandas import dataframe to get the data and work with it .
Import matplotlib and from matplotlib import pyplot to show the data in graph .
From Scikit learn import Linear Regression to calculate Linear Regression formula .
Formula: h_0(x) = θ0 + θ1 . x ,
h_0(x) = Hypotenuos 
θ0 = constant (point where the line touches y-axis) 
θ1 . x = slope .
The line is called prediction line .
Dots are the data points are the .
Distance between the data ponts and the prediction line is called Residual line .
